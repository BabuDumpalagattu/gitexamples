        <h2>HTML & CSS</h2>
        <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are the foundation of web development.</p>
        <p>HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 while he was working at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. It has gone through several versions, with the latest being HTML5.</p>
        <p>CSS was introduced by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie and Bert Bos in 1996. CSS1 was released in 1996, followed by CSS2 in 1998. CSS3 is the latest version, with ongoing developments in CSS4 and beyond.</p>
        <p>Together, HTML and CSS allow developers to create visually appealing and structured web pages.</p>
